William J. Burke is the Lead Algorithm Engineer for the <a href="http://www.geappliances.com/home-energy-manager/"> GE Nucleus</a> home energy manager.  I currently work in Louisville Kentucky at GE Appliance Park, but I recently (May 2010) finished my PhD in <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/">Mechanical Engineering</a> at the <a href="http://berkeley.edu/">University of California Berkeley</a>.  My adviser was <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/faculty/auslander/">David Auslander</a>, and my research focused on the design and control of large scale distributed energy systems.  Further, I'm a husband and father living in the Highland neighborhood of Louisville.  <br>
<br>
I am NOT the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Burke">serial killer by the same name</a> that murdered immigrants in Scotland during the early 19th century.  He and about 100 million others are making it very hard for me to improve my search results. Regardless, you are here now.

<ul>
<li><strong>June 28, 2010</strong> I started work at GE Appliance Park in Louisville Kentucky.  My role is the design of advanced algorithms for the <a href="http://www.geappliances.com/home-energy-manager/">Nucleus</a> home energy management device. </li>
<li><strong>October 14, 2009</strong> I presented <em>PWM Synchronization for Intelligent Agent Scarce Resource Auction</em> at the 2009 Dynamic Systems and Controls Conference in Hollywood CA.  ("Nerds in Hollywood" coming soon to a theater near you.)  Check out my <a href="./research.html">research</a> page for the paper and presentation.  </li>
<li><strong>December 14, 2009</strong> I presented <em>Price Responsive Loads -- Simulation Results</em> to a small audience of technical people and policy makers at the California Energy Commission in Sacramento CA.  The full presentation can be found (as always) on my <a href="./research.html">research</a> page.  </li>
<li><strong>October 14, 2009</strong> I presented <em>PWM Synchronization for Intelligent Agent Scarce Resource Auction</em> at the 2009 Dynamic Systems and Controls Conference in Hollywood CA.  ("Nerds in Hollywood" coming soon to a theater near you.)  Check out my <a href="./research.html">research</a> page for the paper and presentation.  </li>

<li><strong>October 6, 2009</strong> I presented <em>Residential Electricity Auction with Uniform Pricing and Cost Constraints</em> at the 2009 North American Power Symposium in Starkville MS.  My presentation went great -- good crowd and excellent questions.  Go to my <a href="./research.html">research</a> page for more info.  </li>

<li><strong>September 6, 2009</strong> I presented <em>Low Frequency Pulse Width Modulation Design For HVAC Compressors</em> at the 2009 ASME/IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Embedded Systems and Applications in San Diego CA.  Check out my <a href="./research.html">research</a> page for links to the presentation and paper.  </li>

<li><strong>August 10, 2009</strong> I just un-launched my site at wjburke.com. All of that information is now here, and I set up page redirects and forwards for appropriate pages.  Two websites was just too hard to manage, but I still own wjburke.com.  </li>

<li><strong>August 4, 2009</strong> <a href="http://innovations.coe.berkeley.edu/vol3-issue6-aug09/thermostat">Listening to the Price of Power: New Thermostats Could Save Billions</a> -- More press for our PCT project.  This time I'm mentioned by name.  </li>

<li><strong>August 1, 2009</strong> I just launched a new website for all of my professional information.  Check it out at <a href="http://www.wjburke.com"> www.wjburke.com </a> and let me know what you think.  </li>

<li><strong>April 2009</strong> <a href="http://www.citris-uc.org/publications/newsletters/april2009#article-6477"> Listening to the Price of Power: A New Generation of Thermostats can Save California Billions</a> -- Starting in Jan 2006, I worked on a project to produce a proof of concept programmable communicating thermostat (PCT) for the California Energy Commission.  Although this article does not mention my name, I wrote a very large portion of the PCT software.  </li>
