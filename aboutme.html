From an early age I knew I wanted to be an engineer, and a love of motorized vehicles (cars, airplanes, and motorcycles) led me toward mechanical engineering. I started at the University of Kentucky in Lexington Kentucky in the fall of 1995, and in May 2000, I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in mechanical engineering as Summa Cum Laude. I began my professional career shortly there after, and in 2005 I began the long road to attaining my PhD from University of California Berkeley. <br>
<br>
I married the love of my life, Krista Drescher, in 2000, and in 2008 we had our first child, Molly Zelda (no she wasn't named after Princess Zelda). In May 2010 our second beautiful child was born, Penelope Lucinda.  We recently (June 2010) moved from Oakland, California to Louisville Kentucky, an we currently live in the Highlands Neighborhood.   <br>
<br>
I have quite a few hobbies but fewer since the arrival of Molly. I am a technology maven,
and I keep up with my tech blogs using my favorite gadget - <a href="http://www.google.com/help/reader/tour.html">Google Reader</a>. I own a 1978 Honda CB550 that I brought back to life after purchasing it for $250 off of craigslist. I'm an avid runner that likes middle to long distance races - 12k to half marathon. I've played team sports my entire life, but I'm currently without a go-to sport. 

<h2>Education</h2>
<h3>University of California Berkeley</h3>
Berkeley, CA 94720<br>
Sept 2005 -- May 2010<br>
PhD in Mechanical Engineering<br>
<br>
My major was controls, and I minored in MEMS and artificial intelligence. My research advisor was <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/faculty/auslander/">David Auslander</a>, and our research focused on design and control of large scale distributed energy systems. (See my <a href="research.html">research</a> page for more details.)<br>
